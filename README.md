This project is to copy the view first web framework [asta4d](https://github.com/astamuse/asta4d) to golang and it is still in prototype stage.

The recent goals are:

- allow basic request handler mechanism(simplest rule dispatching worked)
- allow basic rendering mechanism (basic logic partly worked)
- allow basic variable injection(nothing yet)

This project will be discarded after the basic skeleton is built.
